Notes for my OSCP adventure

All transcrypted


TODO: 
Write a script that downloads this repo, asks for the password, uncrypts it and then lints all .md to pdf or something.

Or download the repo and run the script or summin.

halfway there! Next step is just linting! 
make sure to make the script executable :D

The command in pandoc is:

pandoc filename.md -f markdown -t pdf -s -o filename.pdf

To add in the script:
- find all .md files in the folder structure
- convert all .md files in the folder structure to pdf
