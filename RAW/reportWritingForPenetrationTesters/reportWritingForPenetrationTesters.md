# Report Writing for Penetration Testers

We will cover the following Learning Units in this Learning Module:

- Understanding Note-Taking
- Writing Effective Technical Penetration Testing Reports

This Module is designed to help Penetration Testers understand how to deliver effective reports to their clients.

# Understanding Note-Taking

In this Learning Unit we will cover the following learning Objectives:

- Review the deliverables for penetration testing engagements
- Understand the importance of note portability
- Identify the general structure of pentesting documentation
- Choose the right note-taking tool
- Understand the importance of taking screenshots
- Use tools to take screenshots

## Penetration Testing Deliverables

A penetration test or red team exercise1 is difficult to script in advance. This is because the tester cannot consistently anticipate exactly what kind of machines or networks the client will want to be tested.

> Even though the outcome of our assessment is ofter unpredictable, is is often recommended to define a detailed scope during the preliminary meetings with the customer. This process is especially very helpful when prioritizing business critical targets within large networks.

While the general execution plan for a penetration test will often follow a particular model, most pentests tend to follow the maxim "no plan survives first contact with the enemy"2. This means that any specific activities we might expect to perform during the engagement might not actually happen, since the reality of the testing environment is almost certainly different than our initial ideas and hypotheses about it. It's therefore difficult to report on penetration tests using prepopulated forms. This is especially the case when the testing is carried out with little prior discussion with the client, for example, if the client is looking to surprise their defending teams in some manner.

As such, instead of preparing a report in advance, the penetration test is executed and notes are taken as it proceeds to ensure that there is a detailed record of what was done. This makes sure that:

- the penetration test can be repeated if it becomes necessary to demonstrate that an issue is real.
- the penetration test can be repeated after remediation to confirm that an issue has been fixed.
- if there's a system failure during the period of the penetration test, the client and tester can determine if the testing was the cause of the failure.

During a penetration test, some activities may not be permitted. We have to be very clear about the Rules of Engagement (RoE)3 under which the testing is done. When conducting red team testing, a person will often be assigned the role of "referee" to ensure that the rules of engagement are observed. There may be constraints placed on testing such as not carrying out denial of service attacks, or not engaging in social engineering. Furthermore, the testing work may be in response to the client's regulatory compliance requirements and may need to follow a specific methodology such as the OWASP Penetration Testing Execution Standard.4 Any such constraints need to be very clear from the outset.

## Note Portability 

Portability of penetration testing notes means being able to pass those notes on to others. Writing notes that are consise and coherent is an integral part of succesful note-taking, and enables the notes to be used not only by ourselves but also by others. Additionally, consise notes can be quickly adapted for technical reporting.

The need for portability is particularly emphasized when a penetration tester has to leave an engagement because of sickness, illness, or other issues. Having a shared understanding of how notes should be taken is especially important for large penetration testing teams, where individuals need to be able to understand teh details of other team members' engagement at will.
