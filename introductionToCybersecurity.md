# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Definiton: cyber is different from other technical fields because it involves _malicious_ and _intelligent_ actors. (e.g. opponents)

## On emulating the minds of our opponent

It's worth pausing to consider the particular attention that we will give to the offensive side of security, even in many of our defensive courses and Modules. One might wonder why a cybersecurity professional whose primary interest and goal is defending a network, organization, or government should also learn the offensive side.

Let's take the analogy of a medieval monarch building a castle. If the monarch learns that their enemy has catapults capable of hurling large boulders, they might design their castle to have thicker walls. Similarly, if their enemy is equipped with ladders, the monarch might give their troops tools to push the ladders off the walls.

The more this monarch knows about their would-be attacker and the more they can think like an attacker, the better defense they can build. The monarch might engage in "offensive" types of activities or audits to understand the gaps in their own defenses. For example, they could conduct "war games" where they direct their own soldiers to mock-battle each other, helping them fully understand the capabilities and destructive potential of a real attacker.

In cybersecurity, enterprises might hire an individual or a firm to perform a penetration test, also known as a pentest. A penetration tester takes on the role of an attacker to better understand the system's vulnerabilities and exposed weaknesses.

Leveraging the skill-sets and mindsets of an attacker allows us to better answer questions like:

    "How might an attacker gain access?"
    "What can they do with that access?" -" What are the worst possible outcomes from an attack?"

While learning hacking skills is (of course) essential for aspiring penetration testers, we also believe that defenders, system administrators, and developers will greatly benefit from at least a cursory education in offensive techniques and technologies as well.

Conversely, it's been our experience that many of the best penetration testers and web application hackers are those who have had extensive exposure to defending networks, building web applications, or administrating systems.
