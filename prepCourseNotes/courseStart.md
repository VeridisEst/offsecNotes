#Eerste paar hoofdstukken


## Challenge labs
### Labs 1-3
Important note: 
  All machines in the challenge labs will have either a 'local.txt' or a 'proof.txt', or both.
The contents of these files are randomized hashes that can be submitted to the OLP to log each compromise, just like the exercise flags. They are like checkpoints.
### Labs 4-6 
These are OSCP machines. Mock-exams. Serious business.
Though these are technically not with point values on the exam the standalone machines would be 20 points each - 60 points total and the ActiveDirectory set is 40 points.

All attack vectors for the machines are taught in the modules (and the training) and/or are leveraged in the first three Challenge Labs. However, the specific requirements to trigger the vulns may differ from the exact scenario's.
